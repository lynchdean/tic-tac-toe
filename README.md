# tic-tac-toe
Expanding upon the React tic-tac-toe tutorial 


| React suggested improvements:                                                             | Implemented |
|---|---|
| Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.     |  |
| Bold the currently selected item in the move list.                                        |  |
| Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.            |  |
| Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order. |  |
| When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.                       |  |
| When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.                        |  |
